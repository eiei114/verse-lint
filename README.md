# verse-lint

Linter for Epic Games' Verse language and UEFN projects.

> Unreleased alpha under active implementation. Only CLI validation is implemented
> in this foundation commit. Source processing currently fails with exit code 2;
> it does not claim to lint or compile Verse. No files are modified.

## Development

Windows x64 is the initial test and distribution target. Rust 1.97.0 (MSVC),
rustfmt and clippy are pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`. 1.97 is the tested minimum,
not a claim that earlier Rust versions cannot work. Install the MSVC build tools
when building from source. Consumers of future prebuilt binaries will not need Cargo.

```powershell
./scripts/verify.ps1
cargo run -- --help
```

Tests and the release build do not replace manual UEFN acceptance. CI never
publishes packages or creates releases. `verse-lint.dev` is a planned, unregistered
project domain, not an active homepage. The linter is independent of `verse-fmt`.

The project is community-built and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Epic Games.
